A very rudimentary Java Desktop Calculator that does basic arithmetic functions.

# What I Learned

Since this was my successful project, it does not entail a lot. But it's a start :)

* Java Language Syntax
* OOP concepts such as class, objects.
* Basic programming knowledge such as methods and parameters
* Succesful use of switch case
